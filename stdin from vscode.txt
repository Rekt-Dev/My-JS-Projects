The process.stdin property returns a stream connected tostdin (fd 0). It is a net.Socket (which is a Duplex stream) unless fd 0 refers to a file, in which case it is a Readable stream.

For details of how to read from stdin see readable.read().

As a Duplex stream, process.stdin can also be used in "old" mode that is compatible with scripts written for Node.js prior to v0.10. For more information see Stream compatibility.

In "old" streams mode the stdin stream is paused by default, so one must call process.stdin.resume() to read from it. Note also that callingprocess.stdin.resume() itself would switch stream to "old" mode.
