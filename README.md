Heya ! 

Thanks for stopping by.


Im a JS noob with 20 years of System/Network/Security & managerial experience.
These are the "projects" I'm building along the way.

Feel free to browse and follow  me through my journey of turning into a coder in my 40's, & feel free to use any piece of software. :D 

Thanks ! 
G'day.
